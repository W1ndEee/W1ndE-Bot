# W1ndE-Bot
This is a Discord bot coded in Node.js & Discord.js. I am currently still slowly working on it.
# Features
- Default moderation tools (Ban, Kick, Timeout).
- Welcome message and Auto Role when people join a Guild.
- Level & XP system.
# Features work in progress
- Twitch integration (Display notification when someone goes live on Twitch).
- Youtube integration (Display notification when a new video is posted on Youtube by someone).
# Branches
- `main` branch is where the current full release is. This is usually only tested and working commands and features.
- `new-feature-testing` branch is where work in progress features are created and tested before publishing to `main` branch.
